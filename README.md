# Lab 2

# Getting Started

- Start by __forking__ this repository, __not__ cloning it. This will create a copy that you own.
- Then, clone your forked copy into the `workspace`  folder. In other words, `cd` into `asic-tools/workspace`, and then `git clone <your forked copy>`

# Lab 2 Specification

In this lab, you will take your accelerator design from lab 1 and take it from design (RTL) to manufacturable chip (GDSII) using the OpenLane toolflow. You will then run post-layout simulation to ensure your laid out chip matches your behavioral verilog.

## OpenLane

Openlane contains every tool needed to take your system verilog to a completed chip, provided you configure it with a `json` or `yaml` file. Create a `config.json` or `config.yaml`. (Most documentation is in `json`, but `yaml` allows comments). Here is an example:

<table><tr><td> Json </td> <td> Yaml </td></tr><tr><td>

```Json
{
    "DESIGN_NAME": "name",
    "VERILOG_FILES": "dir::rtl/*.sv",
    "CLOCK_PERIOD": 10,
    "CLOCK_PORT": "clk",
    "FP_PDN_VOFFSET": 7,
    "FP_PDN_HOFFSET": 7,
    "FP_PDN_SKIPTRIM": true,
    "RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING": true,
    "RUN_POST_GRT_DESIGN_REPAIR": true
}
```

</td><td>

```Yaml
---
DESIGN_NAME: name
VERILOG_FILES: dir::rtl/*.sv
CLOCK_PERIOD: 10
CLOCK_PORT: clk
# Power Distribution Stuff
FP_PDN_VOFFSET: 7
FP_PDN_HOFFSET: 7
FP_PDN_SKIPTRIM: true
RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING: true
RUN_POST_GRT_DESIGN_REPAIR: true
```

</td></tr></table>

### Including Verilog Files

Verilog Files can be discretely named one by one as a list. 

<table><tr><td>

```Json
 "VERILOG_FILES": ["rtl/file1.sv",
  "rtl/file2.sv"],
```

</td><td>

```Yaml
VERILOG_FILES:
- rtl/file1.sv
- rtl/file2.sv
```

</td></tr></table>

We can also use the `dir::` preprocessor command to use wildcard matching. For example, `dir::rtl/*.sv` goes into the `rtl` directory and matches all files ending in `.sv`.

<table><tr><td>

```Json
"VERILOG_FILES": ["dir::rtl/*.sv",
 "dir::rtl2/*.sv"]
```

</td><td>

```Yaml
VERILOG_FILES:
- dir::include/*.svh
- dir::rtl/*.sv
```

</td></tr></table>

### Clocking

The `CLOCK_PERIOD` variable controls the speed target of your design by setting the target period in nanoseconds. 
- For the Skywater 130nm PDK, a typical starting value would be between 100 and 10 ns, or between 10 and 100 MHz. 
- Start your clock period conservatively and lower it until you find your maximum frequency, the frequency at which you start to get warnings about setup time.


### Variables
When configuring the openlane flow, nearly everything is configurable.   
- [Common Variables](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/common_flow_vars.html)
    - Most Common Variables
- [PDK-Specific Variables](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/common_pdk_vars.html)
    - Some variables are specific to the PDK being used (Skywater 130, Global Foundries 180, etc.)
- [All of the Variables](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane/blob/master/docs/source/reference/configuration.md)
    - Can't find a variable? It is probably described here

## Running the Flow
With your configuration done, it is time to run the tools. 

```
openlane --flow Classic <config.json or config.yaml> 
```

Or using the provided Makefile:
`make openlane`
- The makefile creates a link to the most recent run in `runs/recent` to make results easier to find.

### Interpreting Results

- Openlane outputs the results of the flow in the `runs` into a folder tagged with the time/date
- Each step of the flow is numbered
    - `runs/<runDate>/01-verilator-lint` has the results from the first step, linting with verilator
- A sucessful flow will create a `final` directory with output results
    - `runs/<runDate>/error.log` should be empty
    - `runs/<runDate>/warning.log` ideally should be empty, but often is not
        - The most important warnings are timing violations. Keep your eyes out for `Setup violations found` or similar.
- A failure will populate the aformentioned `error.log`, and no `final` directory will be 
    - Check the last (highest-numbered) step for more specific logs to see where things went wrong.

### Viewing the Chip

There are many ways to view your design, including:
- `make openroad` to auto view your last design
- `openroad`: launch with `openroad -gui` and open `runs/<run>/final/odb/<design>.odb`
- `magic runs/<run>/final/mag/<design>.mag` to launch magic
    - Select your design by drawing a box around it. Then type `expand all` in the magic console to see all the cells.
- `klayout runs/<run>/final/klayout_gds/<design>.klayout.gds` to view in KLayout

### Static Timing Analysis (STA)

1. Create the variable `SYNTH_AUTONAME` and set it to true to your config. Then Re-Run the flow.
    - This ensures logic and wires are named based on your verilog instead of arbitrarily numbered. 
    - Important for when we start tracing out timing paths.
    - Not recomended to have this turned on all the time, can cause instability in large designs.
2. Re-Run the flow (`make openlane` or likewise)
3. Open the timing results:
    - `openroad-staprepnr` (step 12) has before-layout timing
    - `openroad-stapostpnr` (step 56) has after-layout timing
    - Within each, `summary.rpt` has a summary of the worst slack (`WS`) and total negative slack (`TNS`)

>[!NOTE] 
>Timing analysis uses __corners__ to cover the slowest and fastest possible performance of your chip, based on fabrication variation and conditions.
>  
>| Process Variation | Temperature   | Voltage   |
>| ----------------- | ------------- | --------- |
>| ss (slow)         | 100 C         | 1.6 V     |
>| tt (typical)      | 40 C          | 1.8 V     |  
>| ff (fast)         | 25 C          | 1.95 V    |
> 
> - __Setup Violations__ occur when your chip's logic is too slow to meet the target frequency
>   - Most likely in slowest corner, `ss_100C_1.6V`
>   - Concerned with "Maxs Paths", longest and slowest paths between registers
> - __Hold Violations__ occur when your chip's logic is too fast, causing a register's input not to be stable.
>   - Most likely in fastest corner, `ff_25C_1.95V`
>   - Concerned with "Min Paths", shortest and fastest paths between registers

4. View the Max Path results in the slowest corner
    - `runs/<run>/56-openroad-stapostpnr/max_ss_100C_1v60/max.rpt` shows the worst max paths.

5. Open your design in `openroad` to visually view the worst max paths.
    - `make openroad` will launch openroad with timing on your most recent run.
    - Navigate to the timing report tab on the right and then click update.
    - Click on your worst paths to see them visualized on your laid out chip.
    - To use openroad manually, launch `openroad` from the command line and input the following commands:
    ```
    read_db runs/recent/final/odb/<name>.odb
    read_lib /foss/pdks/sky130A/libs.ref/sky130_fd_sc_hd/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__ss_100C_1v60.lib
    read_sdc runs/recent/final/sdc/<name>.sdc
    gui::show
    ```

# Deliverables

With your design successfully passed through the OpenLane flow, it is time to find some important statistics. Find and format a report on the following:

- Design Pictures
- Maximum Frequency
    - Iterate over your design, lowering period until you start to hit timing warnings.
- Critical Path
    - After inspecting the post place-and-route (pnr) timing analysis (sta), what signals were involved in your critical path?
    - What line(s) of your verilog code created this critical path? This may take some thinking.
- Design Area and Core Area 
    - Check the `final/metrics.json` of your run. Note the units are square microns / square um.
    - What % of a [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) tile is this? Look for dimensions in `um`.
    - What % of an [Efabless Chipignite](https://efabless.com/products) die is this? Look for area in `sq mm`.
